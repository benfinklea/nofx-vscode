# NofX VS Code Extension - Fixed Issues

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. **Agent Deletion**
- Added `nofx.deleteAgent` command
- Delete agents via:
  - Command Palette: `NofX: Delete Agent`
  - Right-click context menu in Agents view (trash icon)
- Includes confirmation dialog before deletion

### 2. **Conductor Panel Reopening**
- Fixed panel disposal issue
- Added `reveal()` method to EnhancedConductorPanel
- Now properly reopens when closed:
  - Use `Cmd+Shift+O` shortcut
  - Command Palette: `NofX: Show Orchestrator`
  - Click status bar "NofX" item

### 3. **NofX Terminal Panel**
- Restored panel view configuration in package.json
- Panel appears in bottom dock when agents are active
- Shows tabs for each Claude-controlled agent
- Visible when `nofx.hasAgents` context is true

### 4. **Agent Context Menu**
- Added inline actions for agents in sidebar:
  - Edit agent (pencil icon)
  - Delete agent (trash icon)
- Click on agent name to edit

## ❌ Not Implemented

### NofX in Chat Window
- This would require integration with Cursor's proprietary API
- The chat panel is specific to Cursor and not accessible via standard VS Code extension APIs
- Alternative: Use the conductor panel and terminal views for agent interaction

## How to Use

1. **Start Conductor**: `Cmd+Shift+P` → `NofX: Start Conductor`
2. **View Agents**: Check the NofX sidebar (left panel)
3. **See Terminal Panel**: Look for "NofX" tab in bottom panel (appears after agents start)
4. **Delete Agent**: Right-click agent in sidebar → Delete icon
5. **Reopen Conductor**: `Cmd+Shift+O` or click "NofX" in status bar
