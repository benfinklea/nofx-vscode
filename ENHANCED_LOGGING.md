# NofX Enhanced Orchestration Logging 🎸

## Overview
NofX now provides comprehensive logging of all conductor and agent activities, giving you complete visibility into the orchestration process without overwhelming you with agent internal thinking.

## Installation
```bash
# Install the enhanced extension
cursor --install-extension nofx-0.1.0.vsix --force
```

## Output Channels
After installation, you'll have access to 5 dedicated output channels in VS Code/Cursor:

### 1. **NofX Activity** (Main Channel)
- Aggregated view of all activities
- Opens automatically on extension activation
- Shows all major events across the system

### 2. **NofX Conductor**
- Conductor-specific activities:
  - Task evaluation and analysis
  - Task creation and prioritization
  - Agent assignment decisions
  - Coordination activities
  - Decision-making process

### 3. **NofX Agents**
- Agent lifecycle and activities:
  - Agent spawning and initialization
  - Task reception
  - Work progress updates
  - Task completion
  - Status changes

### 4. **NofX Tasks**
- Task management flow:
  - Task creation
  - Queue management
  - Assignment tracking
  - Progress monitoring
  - Completion status

### 5. **NofX Orchestration**
- System-level orchestration:
  - Message routing
  - Event flow
  - Workflow execution
  - Inter-agent communication

## Configuration

### Log Level
You can adjust the verbosity of logging:

```typescript
// In your settings.json
{
  "nofx.logLevel": "verbose" // Options: "verbose", "info", "minimal"
}
```

### Clear Logs

1. Right-click in any NofX output channel
2. Select "Clear Output"

Or programmatically:
```
Cmd+Shift+P → "NofX: Clear Logs"
```

## Benefits

1. **Complete Visibility**: See every decision, assignment, and status change
2. **No Agent Thinking**: Focus on actions, not internal agent deliberation
3. **Real-time Updates**: Watch orchestration happen live
4. **Debugging**: Easily identify bottlenecks or issues
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Track task durations and agent efficiency
6. **Audit Trail**: Complete history of all orchestration activities

## Tips

1. **Keep Main Channel Open**: The "NofX Activity" channel gives you the best overview
2. **Filter by Channel**: Use specific channels when debugging particular aspects
3. **Search Logs**: Use Ctrl+F in output channels to search for specific events
4. **Export Logs**: Right-click → "Copy All" to export logs for analysis

## Troubleshooting

If you don't see logs:
1. Ensure extension is activated (check Extensions panel)
2. Open Output panel (View → Output)
3. Select "NofX Activity" from dropdown
4. Try spawning an agent or creating a task

## Summary Statistics

The logging system also provides periodic summaries:
```
