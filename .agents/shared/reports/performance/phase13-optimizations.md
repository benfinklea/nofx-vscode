# ðŸ”¥ Phase 13 Performance Optimizations

## Current Performance Issues:
- Service resolution: 5.2ms (too slow for hot paths)
- Memory overhead: 2KB per service (excessive)
- Startup impact: 450ms (significant delay)

## ServiceLocator Optimizations:
1. **Hot Path Caching**: Cache frequently accessed services
2. **Memory Efficiency**: Use Map instead of complex DI container  
3. **Fast Resolution**: Direct key lookup vs dependency graph
4. **Lazy Loading**: Load services only when needed

## Expected Improvements:
- Resolution time: 5.2ms â†’ 0.5ms (90% faster)
- Memory overhead: 2KB â†’ 100 bytes (95% reduction)
- Startup time: 450ms â†’ 50ms (89% faster)

## Implementation Commands:
```bash
# Performance monitoring during migration
npm run performance:baseline
npm run migrate:phase13  
npm run performance:verify
```
