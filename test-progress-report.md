# Test Coverage Progress Report

## Summary
Significant progress has been made on test coverage and fixing broken tests. We've achieved the 98% coverage goal for EventBus and made substantial improvements across other key services.

## Current Status

### âœ… Goal Achieved (98%+ Coverage, 100% Passing)
- **EventBus**: 98.26% coverage, 100% tests passing âœ…
  - Exceeds the 98% coverage goal
  - All tests passing without issues

### âœ… Tests Fixed and Passing
- **ConfigurationService**: 80.74% coverage, 100% tests passing
  - All 60 tests passing
  - Fixed TypeScript errors and validation issues
  - Need to add more tests to reach 98% coverage

- **Container**: 74.62% coverage, 100% tests passing
  - Created comprehensive test suite from scratch
  - All 48 tests passing
  - Covers singleton, transient patterns, dependency injection, and disposal

### ðŸ”„ In Progress
- **AgentManager**: 61.31% coverage, 88.9% tests passing (16/18)
  - Fixed majority of test failures
  - Added missing mock methods (startTimer, endTimer)
  - 2 tests still failing (restoration and setup dialog)

## Key Achievements

1. **Created Central Mock Infrastructure**
   - Built `mockFactories.ts` for consistent mocking across all tests
   - Eliminates duplicate mock code
   - Ensures type safety

2. **Fixed Critical Issues**
   - Resolved Sinon to Jest migration issues
   - Fixed TypeScript compilation errors
   - Corrected ValidationError interface mismatches
   - Fixed EventEmitter disposal issues

3. **Improved Test Quality**
   - Added meaningful tests that catch real bugs
   - Comprehensive error handling coverage
   - Edge case testing (circular dependencies, disposal, etc.)

## Next Steps to Achieve 98% Coverage for All Files

### Priority 1: Increase Coverage for Existing Tests
1. **ConfigurationService** (80.74% â†’ 98%)
   - Add tests for orchestration methods
   - Test error recovery paths
   - Cover validation cache scenarios

2. **AgentManager** (61.31% â†’ 98%)
   - Fix remaining 2 test failures
   - Add tests for all agent lifecycle methods
   - Cover task assignment and completion flows

3. **Container** (74.62% â†’ 98%)
   - Add tests for async disposal
   - Cover all error scenarios
   - Test concurrent resolution

### Priority 2: Fix Remaining Test Files
- TerminalManager
- LoggingService
- NotificationService
- MetricsService
- CommandService
- AgentLifecycleManager

## Metrics
- **Files with 98%+ coverage**: 1/4 (25%)
- **Files with 100% passing tests**: 3/4 (75%)
- **Overall test health**: Good progress, approaching goal

## Recommendations
1. Focus on increasing coverage for files that already have passing tests
2. Use the mock factory pattern for all new tests
3. Prioritize testing critical business logic paths
4. Add integration tests after unit test coverage goals are met
