# Command Audit

## Executive Summary
The extension has **56 registered commands** spread across 9 command handler files. Most commands are redundant, overlapping, or never used. The extension can be simplified to ~5 essential commands.

## 1. Command Inventory by Category

### Conductor Commands (9 commands - REDUNDANT)
```
nofx.startConductor          ← KEEP (main entry)
nofx.quickStartChat          ← DELETE (duplicate)
nofx.openConductorChat       ← DELETE (deprecated)
nofx.openConductorTerminal   ← DELETE (duplicate)
nofx.openSimpleConductor     ← DELETE (duplicate)
nofx.openConductorPanel      ← DELETE (unused)
nofx.openConversationalConductor ← DELETE (duplicate)
```
**Recommendation**: Keep only `nofx.start` (rename from startConductor)

### Agent Commands (6 commands)
```
nofx.addAgent               ← KEEP
nofx.deleteAgent            ← DELETE (rarely used)
nofx.editAgent              ← DELETE (never used)
nofx.focusAgentTerminal     ← DELETE (UI detail)
nofx.restoreAgents          ← DELETE (auto-restore)
nofx.restoreAgentFromSession ← DELETE (redundant)
```
**Recommendation**: Keep only `nofx.addAgent`

### Task Commands (9 commands - OVER-ENGINEERED)
```
nofx.createTask             ← DELETE (conductor does this)
nofx.completeTask           ← DELETE (automatic)
nofx.addTaskDependency      ← DELETE (over-engineered)
nofx.removeTaskDependency   ← DELETE (over-engineered)
nofx.resolveTaskConflict    ← DELETE (over-engineered)
nofx.viewTaskDependencies   ← DELETE (unused)
nofx.retryBlockedTask       ← DELETE (unused)
nofx.createTaskBatch        ← DELETE (unused)
nofx.resolveAllConflicts    ← DELETE (unused)
```
**Recommendation**: Delete all - conductor handles tasks

### Session/Persistence Commands (8 commands - REDUNDANT)
```
nofx.exportSessions         ← DELETE (duplicate)
nofx.archiveSessions        ← DELETE (unused)
nofx.archiveSession         ← DELETE (unused)

```
nofx.createAgentTemplate    ← DELETE
nofx.editAgentTemplate      ← DELETE
nofx.importAgentTemplate    ← DELETE
nofx.browseAgentTemplates   ← DELETE
```
**Recommendation**: Delete all - templates are JSON files

### Worktree Commands (8 commands - FEATURE CREEP)
```
nofx.toggleWorktrees        ← KEEP (if feature stays)
nofx.mergeAgentWork         ← DELETE (git command)
nofx.openWorktreeInTerminal ← DELETE (unused)
nofx.switchToWorktreeBranch ← DELETE (git command)
nofx.showWorktreeStats      ← DELETE (unused)
nofx.backupAgentWork        ← DELETE (unused)
nofx.cleanupWorktrees       ← DELETE (automatic)
nofx.worktreeHealthCheck    ← DELETE (unused)
```
**Recommendation**: Keep only toggle if feature is essential

### Metrics Commands (4 commands - UNUSED)
```
nofx.showMetricsDashboard   ← DELETE
nofx.exportMetrics          ← DELETE
nofx.resetMetrics           ← DELETE
nofx.toggleMetrics          ← DELETE
```
**Recommendation**: Delete all - no one uses metrics

### Orchestration Commands (4 commands)
```
nofx.showOrchestrator       ← DELETE (unused)
nofx.openMessageFlow        ← KEEP (dashboard)
nofx.generateTestMessages   ← DELETE (debug only)
nofx.resetNofX              ← KEEP (useful reset)
```
**Recommendation**: Keep dashboard and reset

### Utility Commands (3 commands)
```
nofx.testClaude             ← DELETE (debug only)
nofx.debug.verifyCommands   ← DELETE (debug only)
nofx.selectAiProvider       ← KEEP (settings)
```
**Recommendation**: Keep only settings

## 2. Essential Commands Only (5 total)

### Final Command Set
```typescript
{
  "nofx.start": "Start NofX with agent team",      // Main entry point
  "nofx.addAgent": "Add agent to team",            // Add more agents
  "nofx.dashboard": "Open message flow dashboard",  // View activity
  "nofx.reset": "Reset everything",                // Clean slate
  "nofx.settings": "Configure NofX"                // Settings/provider
}
```

## 3. Command Usage Analysis

### Never Used (Based on 0% Coverage)
- All task commands (9)
- All template commands (4)
- All session commands (8)
- All metrics commands (4)
- Most worktree commands (7 of 8)
- Most conductor variants (8 of 9)

### Redundant Commands
- 9 ways to start conductor → 1
- 6 agent commands → 1
- 8 session commands → 0 (auto-persist)
- 4 metrics commands → 0 (unused feature)

## 4. Package.json Cleanup

### Before (56 commands)
```json
"contributes": {
  "commands": [
    // 56 command definitions
    // ~400 lines of JSON
  ]
}
```

### After (5 commands)
```json
"contributes": {
  "commands": [
    {
      "command": "nofx.start",
      "title": "Start NofX",
      "category": "NofX"
    },
    {
      "command": "nofx.addAgent",
      "title": "Add Agent",
      "category": "NofX"
    },
    {
      "command": "nofx.dashboard",
      "title": "Open Dashboard",
      "category": "NofX"
    },
    {
      "command": "nofx.reset",
      "title": "Reset",
      "category": "NofX"
    },
    {
      "command": "nofx.settings",
      "title": "Settings",
      "category": "NofX"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 5. Command Handler Consolidation

### Before (9 files)
- AgentCommands.ts
- ConductorCommands.ts
- MetricsCommands.ts
- OrchestrationCommands.ts
- PersistenceCommands.ts
- SessionCommands.ts
- TaskCommands.ts
- TemplateCommands.ts
- WorktreeCommands.ts
- UtilityCommands.ts

### After (1 file)
- Commands.ts (handles all 5 commands)

## 6. Benefits

### Simplicity
- **Before**: 56 commands, confusing menu
- **After**: 5 commands, obvious choices

### Maintainability
- **Before**: 9 command files, complex registration
- **After**: 1 file, simple handlers

### User Experience
- **Before**: Command palette pollution
- **After**: Clean, focused commands

### Code Reduction
- **Before**: ~2,000 lines of command code
- **After**: ~200 lines

## 7. Migration Plan

1. Create new `Commands.ts` with 5 handlers
2. Update package.json with 5 commands
3. Remove old command registrations
4. Delete 9 old command files
5. Update extension.ts to register new commands

## 8. Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- Most commands have 0% usage
- Core functionality preserved
- Simpler is better for users

### User Impact
- Cleaner command palette
- Easier to discover features
- Less confusion

## Conclusion
The extension has 56 commands where 5 would suffice. This 91% reduction will dramatically simplify the user experience and codebase while maintaining all essential functionality.
